# Birthday Countdown Website

I made a birthday countdown website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I included a date picker, a button, and constant confetti falling from the top. Once users enter their birthday, the number of days left until their next birthday will be revealed.

I struggled with coding the countdown part, but was able to learn new JavaScript concepts while making this project.
